# CRM Application - Test Task Implementation

## Technologies Used

- Java  
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security  
- Thymeleaf  
- H2 Database (in-memory for hosted version)  

## Live Application

Hosted on Render (free tier):  
[https://crm-1-765w.onrender.com/](https://crm-1-765w.onrender.com/)  

> ⚠️ Since the hosting is free, the application may take a few seconds to start.

## Source Code

GitHub repository:

**Solution:** For the hosted version, I used an **in-memory H2 database**.

- Interactive H2 console is available at:  
  [https://crm-1-765w.onrender.com/h2-console](https://crm-1-765w.onrender.com/h2-console)  
- Change the JDBC URL to:  jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
- Keep other fields as default (no password).

## Login Credentials

- Email: `admin@admin.com`  
- Password: `password`
